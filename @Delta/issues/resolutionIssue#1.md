# Resolution for issue #1: Deployment Failed

### Resolutions:

**1.** *Github* is not a hosting platform for *server side applications.* With the help of Github Pages you can only deploy your static web applications which include only html/css/js files. 

**2.** You will need a **PaaS** *(Platform as a Service)* or a server to deploy your server side applications.

**3.** It is also not recommended to deploy even a front-end application on *Github Pages* that contains sensitive information such as authentication tokens or passwords, credit card information, etc.


### Closing Remarks : Use a hosting service to deploy your php applications.
